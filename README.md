| Cost | Higher (hourly charges) | Lower (pay for storage/traffic) |
| Scalability | Manual/Auto-scaling needed | Automatic |
| Maintenance | High (OS updates, security) | None |
| Performance | Customizable | Good, can use CloudFront |
| Flexibility | Full control | Limited to static files |
| Security | Complex (VPC, SG, Updates) | Simple (IAM, Bucket Policy) |
| Setup Complexity | Complex | Simple |
| SSL/HTTPS | Manual setup needed | Easy with CloudFront |
| Custom Domain | Direct support | Needs CloudFront/Route53 |

## When to Choose What?

### Choose EC2 When:
1. You need server-side processing
2. Your site has dynamic content
3. You require full server access
4. You need custom server configurations
5. You're building a full-stack application
6. You need to run multiple applications
7. You require specific server software

### Choose S3 When:
1. You have a purely static website
2. Cost is a primary concern
3. You want minimal maintenance
4. You need automatic scaling
5. Your site is content-focused
6. You want simple deployment
7. You don't need server-side processing

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up EC2 Hosting
1. Navigate to the `ec2` directory
2. Follow the README in the EC2 folder
3. Key steps:
   ```bash
   cd ec2/terraform
   # Generate SSH key
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ssh_key
   # Deploy infrastructure
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

### Setting Up S3 Hosting
1. Navigate to the `s3` directory
2. Follow the README in the S3 folder
3. Key steps:
   ```bash
   cd s3/terraform
   # Update bucket name in terraform.tfvars
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

## Best Practices

### EC2 Best Practices:
1. **Security**:
   - Use private subnets where possible
   - Implement proper security groups
   - Keep system updated
   - Use SSL/TLS certificates

2. **Performance**:
   - Choose right instance type
   - Monitor resource utilization
   - Use EBS optimization
   - Implement caching

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Regular backups
   - Automated updates
   - Monitor logs
   - Health checks

### S3 Best Practices:
1. **Security**:
   - Use bucket policies
   - Enable versioning
   - Set up access logging
   - Use CloudFront for HTTPS

2. **Performance**:
   - Enable compression
   - Use CloudFront CDN
   - Optimize images
   - Minimize file sizes

3. **Organization**:
   - Clear file structure
   - Proper MIME types
   - Version control
   - Backup strategy

## Cost Optimization

### EC2 Cost Optimization:
1. Use Reserved Instances for long-term
2. Choose right instance size
3. Stop instances when not needed
4. Monitor usage patterns
5. Use spot instances where applicable

### S3 Cost Optimization:
1. Use lifecycle policies
2. Enable compression
3. Monitor data transfer
4. Use CloudFront caching
5. Clean up old versions

## Advanced Features

### EC2 Advanced Features:
1. Auto Scaling Groups
2. Load Balancing
3. Custom SSL certificates
4. Server-side applications
5. Database integration

### S3 Advanced Features:
